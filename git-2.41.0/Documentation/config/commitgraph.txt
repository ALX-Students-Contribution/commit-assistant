commitGraph.generationVersion::
	Specifies the type of generation number version to use when writing
	or reading the commit-graph file. If version 1 is specified, then
	the corrected commit dates will not be written or read. Defaults to
	2.

commitGraph.maxNewFilters::
	Specifies the default value for the `--max-new-filters` option of `git
	commit-graph write` (c.f., linkgit:git-commit-graph[1]).

commitGraph.readChangedPaths::
	If true, then git will use the changed-path Bloom filters in the
	commit-graph file (if it exists, and they are present). Defaults to
	true. See linkgit:git-commit-graph[1] for more information.
