sendemail.identity::
	A configuration identity. When given, causes values in the
	'sendemail.<identity>' subsection to take precedence over
	values in the 'sendemail' section. The default identity is
	the value of `sendemail.identity`.

sendemail.smtpEncryption::
	See linkgit:git-send-email[1] for description.  Note that this
	setting is not subject to the 'identity' mechanism.

sendemail.smtpsslcertpath::
	Path to ca-certificates (either a directory or a single file).
	Set it to an empty string to disable certificate verification.

sendemail.<identity>.*::
	Identity-specific versions of the 'sendemail.*' parameters
	found below, taking precedence over those when this
	identity is selected, through either the command-line or
	`sendemail.identity`.

sendemail.multiEdit::
	If true (default), a single editor instance will be spawned to edit
	files you have to edit (patches when `--annotate` is used, and the
	summary when `--compose` is used). If false, files will be edited one
	after the other, spawning a new editor each time.

sendemail.confirm::
	Sets the default for whether to confirm before sending. Must be
	one of 'always', 'never', 'cc', 'compose', or 'auto'. See `--confirm`
	in the linkgit:git-send-email[1] documentation for the meaning of these
	values.

sendemail.aliasesFile::
	To avoid typing long email addresses, point this to one or more
	email aliases files.  You must also supply `sendemail.aliasFileType`.

sendemail.aliasFileType::
	Format of the file(s) specified in sendemail.aliasesFile. Must be
	one of 'mutt', 'mailrc', 'pine', 'elm', or 'gnus', or 'sendmail'.
+
What an alias file in each format looks like can be found in
the documentation of the email program of the same name. The
differences and limitations from the standard formats are
described below:
+
--
sendmail;;
*	Quoted aliases and quoted addresses are not supported: lines that
	contain a `"` symbol are ignored.
*	Redirection to a file (`/path/name`) or pipe (`|command`) is not
	supported.
*	File inclusion (`:include: /path/name`) is not supported.
*	Warnings are printed on the standard error output for any
	explicitly unsupported constructs, and any other lines that are not
	recognized by the parser.

	one connection.
	See also the `--batch-size` option of linkgit:git-send-email[1].

sendemail.smtpReloginDelay::
	Seconds wait before reconnecting to smtp server.
	See also the `--relogin-delay` option of linkgit:git-send-email[1].

	will abort with a warning if any configuration options for "sendmail"
	exist. Set this variable to bypass the check.
