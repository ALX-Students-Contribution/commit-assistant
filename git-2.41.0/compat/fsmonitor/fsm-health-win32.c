 * Shutdown if the original worktree root directory been deleted,
 * moved, or renamed?
 *
 * Since the main thread did a "chdir(getenv($HOME))" and our CWD
 * is not in the worktree root directory and because the listener
 * thread added FILE_SHARE_DELETE to the watch handle, it is possible
 * for the root directory to be moved or deleted while we are still
 * watching it.  We want to detect that here and force a shutdown.
 *
 * Granted, a delete MAY cause some operations to fail, such as
 * GetOverlappedResult(), but it is not guaranteed.  And because
 * ReadDirectoryChangesW() only reports on changes *WITHIN* the
 * directory, not changes *ON* the directory, our watch will not
 * receive a delete event for it.
 *
 * A move/rename of the worktree root will also not generate an event.
 * And since the listener thread already has an open handle, it may
 * continue to receive events for events within the directory.
 * However, the pathname of the named-pipe was constructed using the
 * original location of the worktree root.  (Remember named-pipes are
 * stored in the NPFS and not in the actual file system.)  Clients
 * trying to talk to the worktree after the move/rename will not
 * reach our daemon process, since we're still listening on the
 * pipe with original path.
 *
 * Furthermore, if the user does something like:
 *
 *   $ mv repo repo.old
 *   $ git init repo
 *
 * A new daemon cannot be started in the new instance of "repo"
 * because the named-pipe is still being used by the daemon on
 * the original instance.
 *
 * So, detect move/rename/delete and shutdown.  This should also
 * handle unsafe drive removal.
 *
 * We use the file system unique ID to distinguish the original
 * directory instance from a new instance and force a shutdown
 * if the unique ID changes.
 *
 * Since a worktree move/rename/delete/unmount doesn't happen
 * that often (and we can't get an immediate event anyway), we
 * use a timeout and periodically poll it.
