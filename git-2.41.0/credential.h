/**
 * The credentials API provides an abstracted way of gathering username and
 * password credentials from the user.
 *
 * Typical setup
 * -------------
 *
 * ------------
 * +-----------------------+
 * | Git code (C)          |--- to server requiring --->
 * |                       |        authentication
 * |.......................|
 * | C credential API      |--- prompt ---> User
 * +-----------------------+
 * 	^      |
 * 	| pipe |
 * 	|      v
 * +-----------------------+
 * | Git credential helper |
 * +-----------------------+
 * ------------
 *
 * The Git code (typically a remote-helper) will call the C API to obtain
 * credential data like a login/password pair (credential_fill). The
 * API will itself call a remote helper (e.g. "git credential-cache" or
 * "git credential-store") that may retrieve credential data from a
 * store. If the credential helper cannot find the information, the C API
 * will prompt the user. Then, the caller of the API takes care of
 * contacting the server, and does the actual authentication.
 *
 * C API
 * -----
 *
 * The credential C API is meant to be called by Git code which needs to
 * acquire or store a credential. It is centered around an object
 * representing a single credential and provides three basic operations:
 * fill (acquire credentials by calling helpers and/or prompting the user),
 * approve (mark a credential as successfully used so that it can be stored
 * for later use), and reject (mark a credential as unsuccessful so that it
 * can be erased from any persistent storage).
 *
 * Example
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * The example below shows how the functions of the credential API could be
 * used to login to a fictitious "foo" service on a remote host:
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * int foo_login(struct foo_connection *f)
 * {
 * 	int status;
 * 	// Create a credential with some context; we don't yet know the
 * 	// username or password.
 *
 * struct credential c = CREDENTIAL_INIT;
 * c.protocol = xstrdup("foo");
 * c.host = xstrdup(f->hostname);
 *
 * // Fill in the username and password fields by contacting
 * // helpers and/or asking the user. The function will die if it
 * // fails.
 * credential_fill(&c);
 *
 * // Otherwise, we have a username and password. Try to use it.
 *
 * status = send_foo_login(f, c.username, c.password);
 * switch (status) {
 * case FOO_OK:
 * // It worked. Store the credential for later use.
 * credential_accept(&c);
 * break;
 * case FOO_BAD_LOGIN:
 * // Erase the credential from storage so we don't try it again.
 * credential_reject(&c);
 * break;
 * default:
 * // Some other error occurred. We don't know if the
 * // credential is good or bad, so report nothing to the
 * // credential subsystem.
 * }
 *
 * // Free any associated resources.
 * credential_clear(&c);
 *
 * return status;
 * }
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
