How to write RIGHT test cases
=============================

Insert the word "ChangeMe" (exactly this form) at a distance of
at least two lines from the line that must appear in the hunk header.

The text that must appear in the hunk header must contain the word
"right", but in all upper-case, like in the title above.

This text is a bit twisted and out of order, but it is itself a
test case for the default hunk header pattern. Know what you are doing
if you change it.

BTW, this tests that the head line goes to the hunk header, not the line
of equal signs.
