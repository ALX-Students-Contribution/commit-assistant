Headings can be right next to other lines of the file:
# RIGHT
Indents of four or more spaces make a code block:

    # code comment, not heading

If there's no space after the final hash, it's not a heading:

#hashtag

Sequences of more than 6 hashes don't make a heading:

####### over-enthusiastic heading

So the detected heading should be right up at the start of this file.
